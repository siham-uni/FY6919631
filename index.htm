<h2 id="abstract"><u>Abstract</u></h2>
<p>
This piece will look over the advantages and drawbacks of using nanotechnology (the science of working with materials between
1 and 100 nanometres) and looking into the usage of materials that stop us from reaching our sustainability goals. This article
evaluates how nanomaterials can increase sustainability, durability, and efficiency in civil infrastructure while also thinking
about the ethics, pricing and availability of these materials.

<h2 id="article"><u>Main Article</u></h2>

<div id="main-article">
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<h3>Current issues with materials used in civil infrastructural techniques</h3>

<p>
The most used material by construction sites worldwide is concrete, which is made from cement, water, and aggregates, which are grainy materials like gravel used to provide strength and volume to the final product. It’s widely used due to its desirable qualities, for example, its exemplary resistance to water, the components of cement being readily available, and the ability to mould concrete into a variety of shapes and sizes.
</p>

<p>
However, with the implementation of smart technology in almost every aspect of human civilisation, construction methods have had to adapt at the same rate to increase their functionality and increase comfort and convenience for humans. Some improvements of current methods include “carbon-based conductive materials”, which would increase the beneficial capabilities of regular concrete like piezoelectricity (where a charge is accumulated as a reaction to mechanical stress) (Li et al., 2020).
</p>

<p>
Another complication with present-day approaches to civil infrastructural techniques is the inability to reach the sustainability goals in place. In 2019, concrete production, or more specifically the production of Portland cement, is estimated to have contributed to around 10% of pollution caused by human activity (Gartner & Sui, 2018). While the demand is something that we can’t control, the efficiency and durability of the concrete can be improved to increase the amount of time these buildings last.
</p>

<h3>How can we incorporate nanotechnology into civil infrastructural techniques?</h3>

<p>
One way nanotechnology can be introduced into current techniques is through altering concrete’s molecular structure. Researchers have identified that incorporating nanoparticles such as nanosilica, nano-titania, or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can significantly increase the compressive strength of traditional concrete mixes by increasing the density and decreasing the risks of micro-cracks (Zhang et al., 2021).
</p>

<p>
Additionally, nanotechnology can be used to produce concrete that possessed self-healing properties which is an innovation looking to address one of the biggest issues with regular cement: crack propagation. Self-healing behaviour can be achieved by including microcapsules filled with healing agents or bacteria that release calcium carbonate as they multiply (Wang et al., 2014).
</p>

<p>
Another big area where nanotechnology contributes to sustainability is in reducing the carbon footprint from cement production. By using nanoparticles like nanosilica, concrete mixes can have the same or better strength with a smaller amount of cement.
</p>

<p>
Nanotechnology also allows for the development of surfaces that have function, which brings increased capabilities to structures. For example, coatings enhanced with nano-titania (TiO₂) can break down pollutants (Chen & Poon, 2009).
</p>

<p>
However, despite these advantages, there are significant limitations and challenges that come with the use of nanotechnology in civil engineering. The main concern involves the cost of producing nanomaterials. In addition, the long-term environmental and health effects of nanoparticle exposure remain under-researched (Donaldson & Poland, 2013).
</p>
<h3 id="Analysis and Discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
<p>
Overall, while nanotechnology has the potential to enhance sustainability and efficiency, its implementation is hindered by economic, regulatory, and ethical challenges.In order for nanotechnology to become a viable implementation within civil engineering, further research is required to ensure the safe, affordable, and standardised use of nanoparticles within large-scale construction projects.
